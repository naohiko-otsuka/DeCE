<h1>ENDF Class Library</h1>

<p>The <tt>ENDFlib</tt> library in DeCE is written in an object
oriented manner, which provides an easy access to the ENDF-6 format
files. There are three important classes defined
in <tt>endflib.h</tt>. The first class is <tt>Record</tt> that is used
for the HEAD and CONT records defined in ENDF-6. The
second one is the main <tt>ENDF</tt> class, in which numerical data in
a specific MT/MT section are stored. The last one is the dictionary
class, <tt>ENDFDict</tt>. The dictionary class is used for controlling
individual section in the ENDF-6 file to be processed, making a new
dictionary section, and access to the overall information of the
currently handling file. </p>

<h2><a name="record">Record Class</a></h2>

<p>A record defined in ENDF-6 is a card image that has six data fields 
in each eleven column - two
floating point data followed by four integers. Following ENDF-6 definition,
DeCE defines this data structure as:</p>

<pre id="dat">
  class Record{
   public:
     double    c1;
     double    c2;
     int       l1;
     int       l2;
     int       n1;
     int       n2;
  };
</pre>

<p>The record-type data are used for the HEAD line in each
MF/MT section, or the CONT (control) line that precedes a
data block.  Note that one data block may contain more than
one CONT, depending on the MT/MT data structure. But at least
one CONT is given in a data block, so that we use a pair of
the CONT field with the data section to be a "block" of data.</p>

<p>All the member variables in the Record class are defined as public,
and they will be zero-initialized by a constructor when no data are
provided.</p>

<p>There is a member function <tt>setRecord()</tt> that set all six
variables at one time.

<pre id="prg">
  void setRecord(double a, double b, int c, int d, int e, int f){
      c1 = a;
      c2 = b;
      l1 = c;
      l2 = d;
      n1 = e;
      n2 = f;
  }
</pre>



<h2><a name="endf">ENDF Class</a></h2>

<p>This class is to store entire data in one MF/MT section, so that
each MF/MT section in DeCE is represented by this object. The class 
is defined as follows:</p>

<pre id="prg">
  class ENDF{
   private:
     bool      allocated;   // memory allocation flag
     int       mat    ;     // ENDF MAT number
     int       mf     ;     // ENDF MF number
     int       mt     ;     // ENDF MT number
     Record    head   ;     // Head Record
     DataSize  size   ;     // ENDF data size
     int       ctr    ;     // pointer to currently running block
     int       nb     ;     // pointer to current block
   public:
     int       *idata ;     // integer data
     double    *xdata ;     // floating point data
     int      **iptr  ;     // int pointer for the 2-dim array
     double   **xptr  ;     // double pointer for the 2-dim array
     Record    *rdata ;     // pointer for 2-dim data CONT
  };
</pre>

<p>The MAT/MF/MT triplet, which is an ID of this section, is kept in
private. The HEAD record is also private. The DataSize is the size of
this object specified by S, M, or L.  In the current implementation in
DeCE, albeit memory access is dynamical, the object memory size is
determined when instanced, hence not able to change.  To save the
memory, the object will be categorized into three depending on a
memory demand. For instance, the resonance parametres need a lot of
memory, which categolized into L, while the nuclear decay data could
be limited to the S size.</p>


<p>The two integers, <tt>NB</tt> and <tt>CTR</tt>, are hidden
variables in the class, required a method to store integer/floating
point data on memory, explained below. <tt>NB</tt> is the number of
blocks stored in an object, and <tt>CTR</tt> is a pointer to the data
block currently the program is accessing. They are used for monitoring
the total number of data points
in <tt>endflib.cpp</tt>. Apparently <tt>CTR</tt> is equal to or
smaller than <tt>NB</tt>.</p>


<p>Numerical data are stored in this object in a one-dimensional
mode. There are three types of data stored; integer, double, and Record.
The integer and double data are also accessed as a two-dimensional
array. For example;</p>
<pre>
 N0    N1    N2    N3    N4    N5    N6    N7    N8    N9    N10
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
</pre>
<p>Where, there are eleven numbers ( = <tt>ni</tt>) in the integer
array <tt>idata</tt>, and the same are accessed by a 2dim array
pointer <tt>iptr</tt>, like <tt>itpr[0][2]</tt>=N2,
<tt>iptr[2][2]</tt>=N9.  The pointer <tt>itpr[0]</tt> contains the
address of <tt>idata[0]</tt>.

<p>The first index, 0, 1, and 2, is common to all the double and
Recode arrays <tt>xptr</tt> and <tt>rdata</tt>, which means that
an <tt>i</tt>-th data block has three relevant data
sets <tt>iptr[i]</tt>, <tt>xptr[i]</tt>, and <tt>rdata[i]</tt>.
In the C(C++) notation for the case above;</p>
<pre id="prg">
   iptr[0] = &idata[0];   xptr[0] = &xdata[0];
   iptr[1] = &idata[3];   xptr[1] = &xdata[6];
   iptr[2] = &idata[7];   xptr[2] = &xdata[8];
   iptr[3] = &idata[11];  xptr[3] = &xdata[14];
</pre>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="ENDF_class.png" width="550" height="600" alt="ENDF class" title="ENDF class" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;"/>
</p>

<p>The last elements (iptr[3] and xptr[3]) point the first addresses
of unused memory, which is needed to calculate number of elements 
for the third block.</p>


<p>At the beginning, <tt>NB = 0</tt>, iptr and xptr
point the fisrt address of the interger number and floating
point number buffers. When data for the first block is stored
(3 integer numbers and 6 floating point numbers), iptr[1]
is set at the 4th element in the integer buffer (idata[3]), and xptr[1]
points the 7th (xdata[6]). The number of elements can be
calculated by the pointers, <tt>NI</tt> = iptr[NB] - iptr[0],
and  <tt>NX</tt> = xptr[NB] - xptr[0].</p>


<p>Sometimes there is no corresponding int/floating point data block
for a given <tt>i</tt>, while the CONT record always exists. When
the <i>i</i>-th block does not have any data, iptr[i] and xptr[i]
point the same address as iptr[i-1] and xptr[i-1].</p>


<p>The MAT/MF/MT triplet as well as the HEAD record can be accessed by
member functions. The <tt>setENDFhead()</tt> function resets the
counter <tt>CTR</tt>. This is function should be called first, when a
new section is created.</p>

<pre id="prg">
  void   setENDFmat(int n){    mat = n;    }
  void   setENDFmf (int n){    mf  = n;    }
  void   setENDFmt (int n){    mt  = n;    }

  int    getENDFmat()     {    return mat; }
  int    getENDFmf ()     {    return mf;  }
  int    getENDFmt ()     {    return mt;  }

  void   setENDFhead(double c1, double c2, int l1, int l2, int n1, int n2){
    head.setRecord(c1,c2,l1,l2,n1,n2);
    resetCTR();
  }
  void   setENDFhead(Record r){
    head = r;
    resetCTR();
  }

  Record getENDFhead(){
    return head;
  }
</pre>



<h2><a name="endfdict">ENDFDict Class</a></h2>

<pre id="prg">
  class ENDFDict{
   private:
    int       mat     ;     // ENDF MAT number
    int       sec     ;     // number of sections
    Record    head    ;     // Tape HEAD Record
    Record    cont[3] ;     // CONT Records
    char      *cbuf   ;     // buffer for TEXT lines and TPID
   public:
    int       *mf     ;     // ENDF MF number
    int       *mt     ;     // ENDF MT number
    int       *nc     ;     // Line count
    int       *mod    ;     // MOD number
    int       *id     ;     // ID for ENDF data on memory
    char     *tpid    ;     // Tape ID 
    Record   *text]5] ;     // text data field
    double    emaxRR  ;     // energy boundary of resolved resonance region
    double    emaxUR  ;     // energy boundary of unresolved resonance region
    double    emaxRe  ;     // either emaxRR or emaxUR depending on LSSF flag
  };
</pre>

<p>An object of ENDFDict class contains MAT number <tt>mat</tt>, Tape
ID <tt>tpid</tt>, Tape header part (one HEAD, three CONTs, and five
lines of text fields) <tt>head, cont</tt>, total number of
sections <tt>sec</tt>, and integer data arrays for each section <tt>
mf, mt, nc, mod</tt>, and <tt>id</tt>. <tt>nc</tt> is the number of
lines (in card image).
<tt>emaxRR</tt>, <tt>emaxUR</tt>, and <tt>emaxRe> define the energy
boundary between the resolved, unresolved resonances, and higher
range.  The array <tt>id</tt> has special meanings, as given
below.</p>

<p>In DeCE, one object is assigned to each section of an ENDF-6 file
defined by MF/MT. For example, when sections are given in
<pre id="prg">
  ENDF lib[0]; // comment section       MF=1, MT=451
  ENDF lib[1]; // resonance parameters  MF=2, MT=151
  ENDF lib[2]; // total cross section   MF=3, MT=1
  ENDF lib[3]; // elastic cross section MF=3, MT=2
  ENDF lib[4]; // capture cross section MF=3, MT=102
               // elastic, no data      MF=4, MT=2
               // spectrum, no data     MF=6, MT=102
</pre>
<p>The total number of sections, <tt>sec</tt> is 7, and 5 sections out
of 7 have real data on memory. The rest of two sections are in the
dictionary, but DeCE has not allocated memory to store these
sections. DeCE gives -1 to their <tt>id</tt>s.

<p>The arrays of <tt> mf, mt</tt>,
and <tt>id</tt> may contain,</p>
<pre id="dat">
 index   MF     MT    ID
   0      1    451     0
   1      2    151     1
   2      3      1     2
   3      3      2     3
   4      3    102     4
   5      4      2    -1
   6      6    102    -1
</pre>

<p>When one section is deleted, DeCE keeps this section on memory, but
set <tt>id</tt> = -2. Now we delete MF/MT=3/2 and 4/2, and add a new
section MF/MT=3/3 to which memory is allocated. <tt>sec</tt> becomes
8. The index for the new section will be 7, and the <tt>id</tt> is
5.</p>
<pre id="prg">
  ENDF lib[5]; // nonelastic cross section MF=3, MT=3
</pre>

<pre id="dat">
 index   MF     MT    ID
   0      1    451     0
   1      2    151     1
   2      3      1     2
   3      3      2    -2
   4      3    102     4
   5      4      2    -2
   6      6    102    -1
   7      3      3     5
</pre>

<p>Finally DeCE prints out sections whose <tt>id</tt> are positive,
in the ascending order of MF and MT.</p>

<p>Two member functions, <tt>scanDisc()</tt> and <tt>getID()</tt>,
give status of each data block.</p>

<pre id="prg">
  int scanDict(int n1, int n2){
    int k = -1;
    for(int i=0 ; i&#60;sec ; i++){
      if( (mf[i] == n1) &#38;&#38; (mt[i] == n2) ){ k = i; break; }
    }
    return(k);
  }
  int getID(int n1, int n2){
    int k = -1;
    for(int i=0 ; i&#60;sec ; i++){
      if( (mf[i] == n1) &#38;&#38; (mt[i] == n2) ){ k = id[i]; break; }
    }
    return(k);
  }
</pre>

<p><tt>scanDict()</tt> looks up a given MF/MT in the dictionary, and
if that section is found, it returns its index, otherwise -1. In the
case of example above, <tt>scanDict(3,3)</tt> gives 7. </p>

<p><tt>getID()</tt> is similar to <tt>scanDict()</tt>, but it returns
the <tt>id</tt> of given section. <tt>scanDict(3,3)</tt> is 5.</p>
